#### About
Crypt is a small project in written in C++, that is the ramblings of our ideas thrown together to try and form a game. Undoubtedly full of bugs and bad optimisations, but we're learning as we go and will hopefully get better. It is worked on inbetween university and other commitments, and so won't be updated too frequently.
